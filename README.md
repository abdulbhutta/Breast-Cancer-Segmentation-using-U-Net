## Getting Started

Please look below on how to run the code or model!

### Prerequisites

Download or Clone this repo.
* Change Path Names, if using Google Colab use the first 7 line of code or if working locally use the last 3 lines. Please update to your paths!
  ```sh

  ```

### Train/Run the Model

Below is an example of how you Train or Test your own model. You must change the path and import the libraries!

To Train: Go to the Train Section in the Notebook
   ```sh

   ```
To Test: Go to the Testing Model on Test Data Section
   ```sh

   ```
